# Twinkie Gallery
A gallery of my dog Twinkie

Utilized Bootstrap to create a gallery of images of my dog Twinkie. In this application, I used the following components from Bootstrap:
1. Jumbotron that contains the gallery title
2. Navigation Bar. At this time, this is just a single application. I have provided a link to my email from the Contact tab but About is not currently linked to anything just yet
3. Achieved a fixed Nav Bar
4. Utilized the Grid System. To achieve a responsive application, within my column settings I use col-lg-4 for 3 images across large viewpoints, medium viewpoints will have 2 images across. To ensure responsive images, I use thumbail within the HTML
